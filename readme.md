Welcome on Ts.ED repository preview. This repository is dedicated to sponsors and the member of the Ts.ED team.
It allows sponsors to preview future features which will then be integrated into the Ts.ED frameworks in a standard release cycle.

So thank your for help !!

## Install a package from Github

Ask Ts.ED team on slack to get an uniq personal GH_TOKEN.

Then add on your project (or on profile level) a `.npmrc` file with the following content:

```
@tsed-preview:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=GH_TOKEN
```

Replace the `GH_TOKEN` by your token or by `${GH_TOKEN}` if you want to use env variable.

If you use yarn (v1), you can also add a `.yarnrc` with the following content:

```
"@tsed-preview:registry" "https://npm.pkg.github.com/tsed-preview"
```

Then add the package to you package.json:

```
{
  "name": "@project/server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A Server based on Ts.ED",
  "main": "index.js",
  "author": "",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "@tsed-preview/fake": "1.0.4"
  }
}
```
